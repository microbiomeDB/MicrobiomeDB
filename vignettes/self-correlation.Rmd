## What is a Correlation Analysis?

Correlations are useful for identifying relationships between variables. When you correlate taxonomic
abundance variables against themselves, it essentially produces a microbial network. Producing and
analyzing these networks is complicated by the fact that microbiome data is inherently compositional.
If not properly accounted for, that can result in a lot of spurious negative correlations. 

## Why Care About Microbial Network Analysis?

Scientists delve into microbial network analysis for a large number of reasons:

**Unraveling Complex Interactions**: Microbial network analysis unveils intricate relationships between 
microorganisms, shedding light on their interconnectedness within ecosystems.

**Diagnostic Potential**: Identifying key nodes in microbial networks can unveil potential diagnostic 
markers, offering a glimpse into microbial dynamics associated with various diseases or environmental 
conditions.

**Insights into Functionality**: Microbial network analysis elucidates functional roles within microbial 
communities, offering valuable insights into their ecological and physiological significance.

From unraveling ecological mysteries to informing medical diagnoses, microbial network analysis proves 
indispensable in understanding the intricate world of microorganisms.

## How are Correlations Calculated?

This package employs SPARCC for correlation analysis between microbial taxa. SPARCC calculates correlations 
that account for the compositional nature of microbiome data.

```{r}
## first lets find some interesting data
microbiomeData::getCuratedDatasetNames()

getCollectionNames(microbiomeData::FARMM)

## grab a collection of interest
## these methods can be used with other data types as well
farmm_metabolomics <- getCollection(microbiomeData::FARMM, "Metabolomics Mass spectrometry assay")

## get a self correlation ComputeResult
## methods spearman and pearson are options here as well, for data known to not be compositional
selfCorrelation_metabolomics <- selfCorrelation(farmm_metabolomics, method='spearman')
```

## Interpreting Results

**Correlation Coefficients**: Assess the strength and direction of correlations. Positive coefficients 
indicate positive correlations, while negative coefficients indicate negative correlations.

**p-values and Adjusted p-values**: Identify biomarkers with statistically significant correlations, 
considering adjustments for multiple testing.

You can extract these metrics and sort and filter results by them:
```{r}
## you can extract network metrics 
selfCorrelation_metabolomics.metrics <- as_tibble(
    getComputeResult(
        selfCorrelation_metabolomics,
        correlationCoefThreshold = 0.5,
        pValueThreshold = 0.05
    )
)

## it's also easy to sort and filter these network metrics
## begin by renaming columns
colnames(selfCorrelation_metabolomics.metrics) <- c('metabolite1', 'metabolite2', 'correlationCoef', 'pValue')
selfCorrelation_metabolomics.metrics %>%
    filter(correlationCoef > 0.5) %>%
    arrange(desc(correlationCoef))
```

You can also visualize them with custom htmlwidgets:

```{r}
## now plot the network
## filters can be applied based on correlation coefficient and p-value
## renders an interactive htmlwidget, using a predetermined layout
correlationNetwork(
    selfCorrelation_metabolomics,
    correlationCoefThreshold = 0.5,
    pValueThreshold = 0.05
)
```

Finally, for more advanced analysis of the network, you can extract it as an igraph object:

```{r}
## if you extract the network as an igraph object, you can get more detailed metrics
selfCorrelation_metabolomics.igraph <- getComputeResult(selfCorrelation_metabolomics, format = 'igraph')
degree <- degree(selfCorrelation_metabolomics.igraph)
edgeBT <- edge_betweenness(selfCorrelation_metabolomics.igraph)
pgRank <- page_rank(selfCorrelation_metabolomics.igraph)
coords <- layout_with_kk(selfCorrelation_metabolomics.igraph)

plot(selfCorrelation_metabolomics.igraph, coords)
```
